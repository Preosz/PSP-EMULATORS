# PSP-EMULATORS
These are some PSP emulators that all are still working

The Download Link for the Emulators: https://mega.nz/file/QIUHEASa#xpvid6dwlVYgl4N-0QCytzykyzfxzLfIUMhedWQdcu0

You can download games for every emulator on romsgames.net or freeroms.com
BEFORE INSTALLING: You need to have your PSP modded with the version "6.61"
Heres the Download Link for "Infinity 2.0" (you need it on your psp to crack it) https://mega.nz/file/kJ01DaTY#YKMW-DaFwVl5Q9l-y4yhSrPqHSPTywD9BZNuodD1m9c
After you did that, your gonna extract the file. Once your in the file itself, your gonna create a folder called "UPDATE". When your done with that, go back to the extracted files and click on the folder called "standard". In there is.a file called "EBOOT.PBP" Your gonna copy paste that file into your new folder called "UPDATE" When your done with that, your gonna leave the folder here first.

Now to the 2nd Mod: https://mega.nz/file/IN0UCRRa#88dJ_DBkbBbU3SHVz_H8QC82jYlIj4KKYPFRXaWlKrg
This time, you dont have to create folders and stuff. Just extract the 7z file. Now your gonna click on the zip data "PSP" then "GAME" and then copy paste the folder called "PROUPDATE" into your Download section.

Now finally, first your gonna plug your PSP with a USB wire into your PC or your memory card. After that, copy paste the first folder you made into the path: /PSP/GAME when its done copying, your gonna disconnect your PSP from your PC. When your on your PSP, go into the game section and install the update that is there now. Once your done, connect your PSP with your PC again. When its connected, your gonna delete the "UPDATE" you placed here earlier. For the final step, copy paste the "PROUPDATE" and the infinity "UPDATE" folder in the right path again as earlier (/PSP/GAMES/) Once you done that, select all the files from the Emulator File and copy paste them right next to the "UPDATE" and "PROUPDATE" folder. Now your gonna run both Installation programms and all the emulators should appear.

I hope you likes this explanation and it helped you. Have a great day!
