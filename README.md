# PSP-EMULATORS
These are some PSP emulators that all are still working

The Download Link for the Emulators: https://mega.nz/file/QIUHEASa#xpvid6dwlVYgl4N-0QCytzykyzfxzLfIUMhedWQdcu0

You can download games for every emulator on romsgames.net or freeroms.com
BEFORE INSTALLING: You need to have your PSP modded with the version "6.61"
Heres the Download Link for "Infinity 2.0" (you need it on your psp to crack it) https://mega.nz/file/kJ01DaTY#YKMW-DaFwVl5Q9l-y4yhSrPqHSPTywD9BZNuodD1m9c
After you did that, your gonna extract the file. Once your in the file itself, your gonna create a folder called "UPDATE". When your done with that, go back to the extracted files and click on the folder called "standard". In there is.a file called "EBOOT.PBP" Your gonna copy paste that file into your new folder called "UPDATE" When your done with that, your gonna leave the folder here first.

Now to the 2nd Mod: https://mega.nz/file/IN0UCRRa#88dJ_DBkbBbU3SHVz_H8QC82jYlIj4KKYPFRXaWlKrg
This time, you dont have to create folders and stuff. Just extract the 7z file,
